This program uses emacsclient program to launch eshell. If you are going
to use this program as is, you'll need to change the top line in
emacs-term.lisp for the path to your socket file for your running Emacs.
You could substitute this with executing Emacs each time.

This program makes external commands to wmctrl and xdotool. Both can be
installed on an Ubuntu/Debian system with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo apt install wmctrl xdotool
#+END_EXAMPLE

This program will not work without them.
